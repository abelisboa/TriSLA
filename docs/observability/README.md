# Observability

Observability in TriSLA is a cross-cutting, non-functional architectural capability that enables internal behavior exposure, auditability, and experimental validation.

## Definition of Observability in TriSLA

Observability in TriSLA is the architectural capability to:

1. **Expose Internal Behavior**: Make internal module behavior visible through metrics, traces, and logs
2. **Enable Auditability**: Provide evidence trails for decision-making processes, enabling verification of system behavior
3. **Support Experimental Validation**: Enable reproduction and validation of experimental results through observable signals

## Why Observability is Architectural, Not Tooling

Observability is not merely a collection of tools (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry). It is a **first-class architectural concern** because:

- **Decision Traceability**: Every admission decision must be traceable from intent submission to final outcome
- **Experimental Reproducibility**: Metrics and traces enable third parties to reproduce and validate experimental claims
- **Operational Transparency**: Internal behavior must be observable without requiring access to source code or internal knowledge
- **Audit Requirements**: Scientific publication requires evidence trails that demonstrate system behavior

## What Is Observed

### Decision Lifecycle

- **Intent Submission**: When and how intents are submitted (Portal Backend)
- **Semantic Processing**: How intents are interpreted and NESTs are generated (SEM-CSMF)
- **ML Prediction**: Risk scores, confidence levels, and prediction latency (ML-NSMF)
- **Decision Making**: Decision outcomes (ACCEPT, RENEG, REJECT) and justification (Decision Engine)
- **Blockchain Registration**: On-chain transaction hashes and block numbers (BC-NSSMF)
- **SLA Lifecycle**: Lifecycle state transitions and compliance monitoring (SLA-Agent)

### Correlation Identifiers

- **intent_id**: Generated by SEM-CSMF, propagated across all modules
- **decision_id**: Generated by Decision Engine, links decision to intent
- **sla_id**: Generated by BC-NSSMF or Decision Engine, identifies SLA instance
- **nest_id**: Generated by SEM-CSMF, identifies Network Slice Template
- **trace_id**: OpenTelemetry trace ID, enables end-to-end trace correlation

## What Is NOT Observed

- **User Personal Data**: No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is logged or traced
- **Internal Credentials**: Authentication tokens and secrets are not exposed
- **Business Logic Details**: Internal algorithm implementations are not logged (only outcomes)
- **Network Topology**: Specific network paths and internal routing are not exposed

## Modules Covered

All TriSLA modules expose observability signals:

- **SEM-CSMF**: Intent processing metrics, semantic translation latency, ontology reasoning latency
- **ML-NSMF**: Prediction requests, risk scores, confidence levels, model inference latency
- **Decision Engine**: Decision pipeline latency, decision outcomes, SLA validation latency
- **BC-NSSMF**: Blockchain transactions, commit latency, block height, pending transactions
- **SLA-Agent**: Lifecycle transitions, violation detection, contract compilation latency
- **NASP Adapter**: Metrics collection latency, platform integration errors
- **Portal Backend**: API request counts, latency, error rates

## Observability Stack

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and querying
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing (OTLP)
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards (optional)
- **ServiceMonitors**: Kubernetes-native Prometheus service discovery
